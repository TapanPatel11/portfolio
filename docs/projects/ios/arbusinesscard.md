# AR Business Card: Your Business in Augmented Reality  

## Project Overview  
!!!abstract "How it started?"
    While exploring and experimenting with iOS development, I created a sample app called **AR Business Card**.  

    My vision was to create a **live business card** that could be experienced in augmented reality. The project utilized **Apple’s ARKit image recognition** to display interactive AR elements. By touching specific AR objects (e.g., a LinkedIn icon), the app would display relevant information like my LinkedIn profile URL.
