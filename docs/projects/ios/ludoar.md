# Ludo AR: Bringing the Classic Game to Augmented Reality  

## Project Overview  
!!!abstract "How it started?"
    While exploring and learning iOS development, I created a sample and experimental iOS app called **Ludo AR**. The app leverages Apple’s **ARKit** to bring the classic LUDO board game into the augmented reality world.  

    This project was my attempt to recreate the beloved LUDO game in AR, combining my passion for iOS development and my curiosity about augmented reality technologies.

## Learning Experience  
!!!Example "What I learned?"
    The journey of building Ludo AR was both challenging and rewarding. It taught me a great deal about:  

    - [x] **Swift programming** and the inner workings of ARKit.  
    - [x] The fundamentals of **3D modeling**, including rigging and animating models.  

    Despite having zero prior experience with 3D modeling, I took on the strenuous task of using, rigging, and animating 3D assets to make the game come alive. This added a whole new dimension to my understanding of iOS app development and AR-based applications.
